  My second project(third task) of my internship with Prodigy Infotech
In today's digital landscape, ensuring the security of our online accounts is paramount. One of the simplest yet most effective ways to enhance security is by using strong passwords. The Password Strength Checker is a Node.js script designed to evaluate the strength of a password entered by the user. This tool not only assesses the password but also provides feedback on how to improve it, making it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to improve their online security
## Criterias included
   -Length of password
   -Uppercase and lowercase letters
   -Numbers and special characters

## Key concepts
  The Password Strength Checker operates on several key principles:
  -Password Evaluation:It assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria, including length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase,    digits, and special characters), and provides a score.
  -Feedback Mechanism: Users receive constructive feedback on how to enhance their password strength.
  -User Interaction: The script can accept a password as a command-line argument or prompt the user to enter one securely.
